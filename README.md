# check-scripts â€“ An assortment of recurring scripts

This repository contains scripts that run according to a schedule on my home
server.

## `perm.py`

PERM is the immigration process that comes before filing a green card. It is
long and tedious, and its processing time varies from month to month. Each month
a bulletin is posted at https://flag.dol.gov/processingtimes, showing how
long the wait for PERM is. This script checks that URL periodically and sends a
notification when a new bulletin is published.

## `uscis-status.py`

For most immigration documents, USCIS provides a receipt number. This number can
be used on the https://egov.uscis.gov website to check the case status. This
script checks that URL periodically and sends a notification when the case
status changes. It also keeps a history of previous status.
